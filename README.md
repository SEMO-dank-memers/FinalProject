# Final Project

### By the SEMO Dank Memers

This is our final Project for our CS 373 course, Intro to Game Programming.

## Great, so what is it?

It's a game about a wizard who gets his property damaged by trolls, so in response he murders them all by rolling a rock over them.

It's supposed to be like one of those games where you get further each time, but there's no actual goal, like no final boss or anything.

## How do I play it?

You don't, at least not right now. You can download the source and open it in Unity, do a build or whatever yourself, but it is still a WIP.

## Okay, so... how do I download and run it?

Excellent question. First, go download [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive?_ga=2.218580569.1924999015.1510763855-1343938853.1506357783) Version 5.6.0 (you can get an earlier one, but it might not work).

Then get a git client. I'm impartial to [MinGW](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html) personally. You'll have to grab the one *with* git, or just choose the one that isn't *without* git. I think you can figure it out, you're smart.

Next, you'll want to extract MinGW to a folder, go into it, and double click set_distro_paths (only for the first time).

After that, double click the distro window thing, it'll open up a cmd line, and you're in!

(NOTE: If you want to put your directory somewhere else, that's fine by me. But I'm not teaching you how to manage directories on a command line, so you'll have to figure that out yourself.)

Type (or paste) this command into the command line:

`git clone https://github.com/SEMO-dank-memers/FinalProject.git`

Then, when that's done. You can open this in unity by opening this folder in the Unity editor (it'll be in the MinGW directory if you're having trouble finding it).

And that's pretty much it. Play it in the editor or build it, I don't care.

## Final Words

This is a final project, not a professional game, so don't judge it too harshly. Also, have fun!
